        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nwankwo Ikechukwu Henry, I am a 19 year old male Computer science student studying at the University of Southwales in its Treforest Campus. My enthusiasm for Computers and computer related entities sparked up as a child when my
young and ever innovative mind thought it would be an outstanding idea to dismantle my
personal computer and see ways in which I could put it back together to either be a
modified version of the original or just more visually appealing. After doing this, having
gained a lot of knowledge about the different PC components are and what their roles are in
the functioning of the computer, it turned out being really fascinating to me, and my
enthusiastic self-decided to try it a couple more times but this time it was tried with other
devices asides a computer like a Play station console, Xbox console and an iPhone.
Because the hardware was so interesting to me, I decided to go on to build by own personal
computer. This was a very interesting experience for me and found out that it was mostly
intuitive for me because of the knowledge of computer hardware I've gained over the years.
With emerging technologies coming up and over the course of years playing around and
educating myself of different technology and technological devices, it was also found out
that an interest for Artificial Intelligence (AI) was developed. I find it really fascinating that
there are computer systems that have been developed and are still being developed to
perform typically human related tasks but a lot better and, in most scenarios, without any
errors. I also have an affinity for electric vehicles and how they operate. The Tesla is a very
good example of that, it is quite amazing to me that the engineers were able to integrate
full self-driving capabilities into the vehicle that and that it would require little to no user
input.
Daily, I try to learn and equip myself with more skills and qualities I enjoy and would be
beneficial towards me and my affinity for computer systems. I strive to educate myself daily
about the advancement in technology and how they function. As I grew older, I grew
enthusiastic for a different aspect of computing which was programming.
In College, I studied a Computing with cyber security course. In the 2 years spent in college, I obtained a national foundation diploma in
computing and a National Extended diploma in computing. I was able to take on units like
Programming, development of websites, Relational Database Management and computer interfaces. In addition to these
qualifications, I also gained leadership, time management and disciplinary skills while in
college. With these skills, I feel, and am confident that I can take on any task no matter the
challenge and come out with a positive result.
Technological advancements occur daily and become increasingly fascinating, from the
development of mobile phones with physical keyboards to development of ones with on
screen keyboards, increasing my love for the technological world. <br> Having listed my 'work' related affinities, hobbies and foundational background, I do also have many 'non-work' related hobbies and interests, some of which include but are not limited to swimming, working, playing video games, playing with devices(understanding how and why they do what they do). I do also enjoy drawing and playing football. My favourite football club is Manchester city of the English Premier league and Barcelona of the Spanish Laliga. <br> If I were asked to rank my hobbies from favourite to list, I would not be entirely sure on where each hobby goes but I do know for a fact that Playing/Watching football and non-destructive tampering of devices would be amongst the top category. <br> I play left wing position on the pitch and I enjoy this because being a right footed player who enjoys playing with flare, It gives me a better chance to show case my talent. </p>
